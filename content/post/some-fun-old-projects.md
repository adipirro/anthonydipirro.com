## Rock Band Network Downloadable Content

During my time at Alt-Strum Productions, I worked on over 100 songs which would become downloadable content for the video game Rock Band.  As VP of Programming, my responsibilities varied quite a lot. On top of managing a team of approximately ten people, I handled day to day production tasks, audio mixing, song authorship, and quality assurance. 

### Some examples of songs I worked on:

## Adaptable Energy Rifle (A.E.R)

This is a small project I worked on over the summer of 2013 to acclimate myself with the Unreal Development Kit.  The A.E.R. allows the player to change various properties of the weapon (Power, Accuracy, Fire Rate, and Number of Projectiles) on the fly in order to "adapt" to whatever situation they are in.  The A.E.R. pulls its energy from the crystal installed inside the gun, generating heat each shot which is dispensed via the heat sink.  To demonstrate the functionality I also put together a small test level to play around in.

## Galaxy At War

This was the final project for the COSC 457 - Computer Game Programming course I took at Eastern Michigan University.  Created in just six short weeks alongside two other talented students, our project went on to be featured in the Undergraduate and Graduate Symposiums.  It is a pretty straightforward space combat game, but it does have some interesting ideas, namely the ability to "light jump" (similar to Dishonored's Blink power) and the 3D Radar.
